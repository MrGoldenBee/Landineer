Go to assets in the top toolbar of Unity
editor and select Import from the dropdown list.
Navigate to this asset file and import.
After import try opening the scene named 
inventory (located in the package itself, visible after importing).
Play the scene and u can left click - and drag the slot couloumns(i acctually forgot its spelling).
U could move it up and down. If u dont like the scroll method, tell me on DISCORD
so i can change it. If u like the design, also lemme know on DISCORD.

I will attach a new README on how to use the prefab in other scenes(like the main scene
you are workin on).

THATS ALL, LEMME KNOW IF IT THROWS AN ERROR.
